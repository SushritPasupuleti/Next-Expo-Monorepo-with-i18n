# Next Expo Monorepo with i18n

Using i18n for internationalization in a Solito Monorepo with a Next and Expo app.

Repo was bootstrapped using `create-solito-app` and then modified to include i18n.

## Getting Started

The locales used for this example are stored in the `locales` directory. This directory will then be copied into the `next` and `expo` apps later.
